    "# Topic modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modelling is the process of grouping large volumes of text into *topics*, that is collections of texts that align in the words that they use. At the conceptual level, topic modelling tries to cluster representations of the texts based on some similarity metric. As a result, there are many different approaches and techniques for topic modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this workshop we will use BERTopic, a method that leverages the embeddings that are discussed in one of the other tutorials. This example will use the same news content about `climate change` and `global warming` as the other examples."

Note that the topic `-1` is included as a catch-all for any texts that do not fit within a clear topic, and as such should not be considered as cohesive topic. The probabilities indicate a measure of confidence in the topic model that this is the correct topic assignment for a given text. This can vary significantly between texts.\n",

These representative words and docs are typically enough to characterise the largest topics.\n",

If a topic is small relative to the size of your dataset it is more likely to have formed around highly specfic cases or anomalies in the data.

Normally, we can avoid these issues with topic size by considering only the largest topics for subsequent analysis, such as the top 10.\n",
