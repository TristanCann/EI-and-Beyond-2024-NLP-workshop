    "# Topic modelling\n",

    "Topic modelling is the process of grouping large volumes of text into *topics*, that is collections of texts that align in the words that they use. At the conceptual level, topic modelling tries to cluster representations of the texts based on some similarity metric. As a result, there are many different approaches and techniques for topic modelling.\n",

    "This set of topic information tells us all we need to know about the clusters forming around texts. `Count` indicates the number of texts assigned to this topic, `Representation` leverages TF-IDF to rank the key terms that characterise a topic and `Representative_Docs` returns the texts closest to the topic's TF-IDF representation. These representative words and docs are typically enough to characterise the largest topics.\n",

    "In the example above, we can see topics forming around Pope Francis, Canadian politics and Indian PM Modi arriving at COP26. Many of the topics reference COP26, a key event at the time this data was produced.\n",

    "Topic size is an important factor when considering the quality of a topic. If a topic is small relative to the size of your dataset it is more likely to have formed around highly specfic cases or anomalies in the data. Here the smallest topic is approximately 1\\% of the dataset at 11 documents. Normally, we can avoid these issues with topic size by considering only the largest topics for subsequent analysis, such as the top 10.\n",

    "A major strength of the BERTopic method is how customisable it is with different embedding components. We can pass any embeddings we want to the model to check their effect on the topics we find. Here we'll try the `all-distilroberta-v1` model, but you can find a list of pre-trained models in the [documentation](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html)."

Canadian politics, Boris Johnson and Pope Francis are common catalysts, whereas others such as COP26 are captured differently. Comparing topics across different model parameters can be a good way to assess their quality. Those that are consistent are likely to be more robust and clearly defined in your data.\n",
